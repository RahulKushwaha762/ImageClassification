A CNN image classifier to detect, if an image has Dog or Cat in Real Time.
The model is trained using CNN.

Two methods to recognise are:

1. User needs to show an image on top left screen and capture the screen , the image of cat or dog to detect in realtime. 
One can show video on youtube or can show the downloaded image.
2. User can also replace the test.jpg file present in repository and test on various images(just by replacing).
